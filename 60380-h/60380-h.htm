<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i" id="Page_i">[i]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">Introduction.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> popular story of Whittington and his Cat is one in
which a version of a wide-spread folk-tale has been grafted
upon the history of the life of an historical character, and in the
later versions the historical incidents have been more and more
eliminated. The three chief points in the chap-book story are,
1, the poor parentage of the hero; 2, his change of mind at
Highgate Hill by reason of hearing Bow Bells; and, 3, his
good fortune arising from the sale of his cat. Now these are
all equally untrue as referring to the historical Whittington,
and the second is apparently an invention of the eighteenth
century. When the Rev. Canon Lysons wrote his interesting
and valuable work entitled <i>The Model Merchant</i> he showed the
incorrectness of the first point by tracing out Whittington&#8217;s
distinguished pedigree, but he was loath to dispute the other
two. It is rather strange that neither Mr. Lysons nor
Messrs. Besant and Rice appear to have seen the work
which I now present to my readers, which is the earliest
form of the life of Whittington known to exist. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
printed from the copy in the Pepysian Library, a later edition
of which, with a few typographical alterations, will be found in
the British Museum library. This <i>History</i> will be found to
differ very considerably from the later and better-known story,
which appears to have been written early in the eighteenth
century. A comparison between the latter which I print at
the end of this Preface (p. xxix.) with T. H.&#8217;s earlier text will
not, I think, be found unprofitable. <i>The Famous and Remarkable
History</i> here reprinted is undated, but was probably published
about 1670; the later edition in the British Museum is dated
1678. One passage on page 7&mdash;&#8220;The merchant went then to
the Exchange, which was then in Lumber-street, about his
affairs&#8221;&mdash;seems to show that it was originally written quite
early in the century, and it is just possible that T. H. stands for
the voluminous playwright and pamphleteer Thomas Heywood.
The Exchange was removed to its present site in 1568, and
therefore our tract could not have been written before that date,
but must have appeared when the memory of the old meeting-place
was still fresh in public memory. On page 11 it will be
seen that Whittington, when discontented with his position in
Fitzwarren&#8217;s house, set out before day-break on All Hallows-day
with his clothes in a bundle, in order to seek his fortune
elsewhere. He had only got as far as Bunhill when he heard
Bow bells ring out what appeared to be&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London,</div>
<div class="verse">Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>These words took complete possession of him, and he returned
before it was known that he had run away. In the more
modern chap-book Whittington is made to reach Holloway,
where it would be less easy to hear Bow bells, and from which
place he would have found it more difficult to return before
the cook had risen. As far as I can find there is no allusion
to Holloway or Highgate hill in any early version, and it is
evident that this localization is quite modern. Mr. Lysons
is certainly wrong when he says that at Highgate &#8220;a stone
continued to mark the spot for many centuries.&#8221; It is not
known when the stone was first erected there, but it was
probably put up when the name of the place was first foisted
into the tale. One stone was taken away in 1795, but others
have succeeded it, and now there is a Whittington Stone
Tavern; and the situation of Whittington College, which was
removed to Highgate in 1808, has helped to favour the supposition
that Whittington himself was in some way connected
with that place.</p>

<p>The form of invitation which the bells rung out varies very
much in the different versions.</p>

<p>In Richard Johnson&#8217;s ballad (1612) we find&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">&#8220;Whittington, back return.&#8221;</p>

<p>which is then amplified into&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Turn againe, Whittington,</div>
<div class="verse">For thou in time shall grow</div>
<div class="verse">Lord Maior of London.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>In T. H.&#8217;s <i>History</i> (see p. 11) we have&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the later chap-book version this is altered into&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Turn again, Whittington,</div>
<div class="verse">Lord Mayor of great London.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It will be seen that the special reference to the fact that
Whittington was three times Lord Mayor is not to be found
in either the ballads or the chap-books.</p>

<p>In the <i>Life</i>, by the author of <i>George Barnwell</i> (1811),
however we read&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Return again, Whittington,</div>
<div class="verse">Thrise Lord Mayor of London.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>And in <i>The Life and Times of Whittington</i> (1841)&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Turn again, turn again, Whittington,</div>
<div class="verse">Three times Lord Mayor of London.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>In the early version of the <i>History</i> by T. H. the fanciful
portions are only allowed to occupy a small portion of the
whole, and a long account is given of Whittington&#8217;s real
actions, but, in the later chap-book versions, the historical
incidents are ruthlessly cut down, and the fictitious ones
amplified. This will be seen by comparing the two printed
here. Thus T. H. merely says (p. 6) that Whittington was
obscurely born, and that being almost starved in the country
he came up to London. In the later chap-book the journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
to London is more fully enlarged upon (p. xxxiii.), and among
those at Whittington&#8217;s marriage with Alice Fitzwarren the
name of the Company of Stationers not then in existence is
foisted in (pp. xlii.) It does not appear in T. H.&#8217;s <i>History</i>.</p>

<p>In many other particulars the later chap-book which contains
the story as known to modern readers is amplified, and
thus shows signs of a very late origin.</p>

<p>With regard to the three fictitious points of Whittington&#8217;s
history mentioned at the beginning of this preface, the first&mdash;his
poor parentage&mdash;is disposed of by documentary evidence;
the second&mdash;his sitting on a stone at Highgate hill&mdash;has been
shown to be quite a modern invention; and the third&mdash;the
story of the cat&mdash;has been told of so many other persons in
different parts of the world that there is every reason to believe
it to be a veritable folk-tale joined to the history of Whittington
from some unexplained connection. None of the early
historians who mention Whittington allude to the incident of
the cat, and it is only to be found in popular literature, ballads,
plays, &amp;c. The story seems to have taken its rise in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth. The reason why however the life
of Whittington should have been chosen as the stock upon
which this folk-tale should be grafted is still unexplained.
Some have supposed that he obtained his money by the
employment of &#8220;cats,&#8221; or vessels for the carriage of coals; but
this suggestion does not appear to be worthy of much consideration.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>It is said that at Newgate, which owed much to Whittington,
there was a statue of him with a cat, which was destroyed in
the Great Fire; and in 1862, when some alterations were
made in an old house at Gloucester, which had been occupied
by the Whittington family until 1460, a stone was said to
have been dug up on which was a basso-relievo representing
the figure of a boy carrying a cat in his arms. This find,
however, appears rather suspicious.</p>

<p>Keightley devotes a whole chapter of his <i>Tales and Popular
Fictions</i> to the legend of Whittington and his Cat, in which
he points out how many similar stories exist. The <i>Facezie</i>,
of Arlotto, printed soon after the author&#8217;s death in 1483,
contain a tale of a merchant of Genoa, entitled &#8220;Novella
delle Gatte,&#8221; and probably from this the story came to
England, although it is also found in a German chronicle of the
thirteenth century. Sir William Ouseley, in his <i>Travels</i>, 1819,
speaking of an island in the Persian Gulf, relates, on the
authority of a Persian MS., that &#8220;in the tenth century, one
Keis, the son of a poor widow in Siráf, embarked for India
with a cat, his only property. There he fortunately arrived
at a time when the palace was so infested by mice or rats that
they invaded the king&#8217;s food, and persons were employed to
drive them from the royal banquet. Keis produced his cat;
the noxious animals soon disappeared, and magnificent rewards
were bestowed on the adventurer of Siráf, who returned to that
city, and afterwards, with his mother and brothers, settled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
the island, which from him has been denominated Keis, or
according to the Persians Keisch.&#8221; Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps
quotes from the <i>Description of Guinea</i> (1665) the record of
&#8220;how Alphonso, a Portuguese, being wrecked on the coast of
Guinney, and being presented by the king thereof with his
weight in gold for a cat to kill their mice; and an oyntment
to kill their flies, which he improved within five years to
6000<i>l.</i> in the place, and, returning to Portugal after fifteen
years traffick, became the third man in the kingdom.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
Keightley also quotes two similar stories from Thiele&#8217;s <i>Danish
Popular Traditions</i> and another from the letters of Count
Magalotti, a Florentine of the latter half of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>Mr. Lysons gives much information as to the great value of
cats in the Middle Ages, but the writer of the <i>History of
Whittington</i> does not lead us to believe that they were dear in
England, for he makes the boy buy his cat for one penny. The
two following titles are from the Stationers&#8217; Registers. The
ballad is probably the one subsequently referred to as by
Richard Johnson:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe birthe,
his great fortune, as yt was plaied by the Prynces Servants.
Licensed to Thomas Pavyer, Feb. 8, 1604-5.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Ballad, called The vertuous lyfe and memorable death
of Sir Richard Whittington, mercer, sometymes Lord Maiour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of the honorable Citie of London. Licensed to John Wright,
16 July, 1605.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first reference that we find to the cat incident is in the
play <i>Eastward Hoe</i> by Chapman, Ben Jonson, and Marston;
for, as the portrait which was said to have existed at Mercers&#8217;
Hall is not now known, it can scarcely be put in evidence.
This half-length portrait of a man of about sixty years of age,
dressed in a livery gown and black cap of the time of Henry VIII.
with a figure of a black and white cat on the left, is said to have
had painted in the left-hand upper corner of the canvas the
inscription, &#8220;R. Whittington, 1536.&#8221;</p>

<p>In <i>Eastward Hoe</i>, 1605, Touchstone assures Goulding that
he hopes to see him reckoned one of the worthies of the city
of London &#8220;When the famous fable of Whittington and his
puss shall be forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next allusion is in Thomas Heywood&#8217;s <i>If you know not
me, you know nobody</i>, 2nd part, 1606.</p>

<div class="hangingindent">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>Here it will be seen that, although the popular tale is mentioned,
it is treated as a mere invention unworthy of credence.</p>

<p>The next in point of time is the ballad by Richard Johnson,
published in the <i>Crowne Garland of Goulden Roses</i> (1612),
which probably had a much earlier existence in a separate form.
It is the earliest form of the story of Whittington now in
existence.</p>

<p>This ballad, as it stands here with the exception of the last
stanza, was reprinted in <i>A Collection of Old Ballads</i>, 1823,
vol. i. p. 130.</p>

<p>This ballad is the original of all the later ballads, although
the titles have been greatly varied. The Roxburghe ballad
(vol. iii. p. 58) is dated in the British Museum Catalogue
1641[?]. Its full title is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;London&#8217;s Glory and Whittington&#8217;s Renown, or a Looking
Glass for Citizens of London, being a remarkable story how
Sir Richard Whittington (a poor boy bred up in Lancashire)
came to be three times Lord Mayor of London in three several
kings&#8217; reigns, and how his rise was by a cat, which he sent by a
venture beyond sea. Together with his bountiful gifts and
liberality given to this honourable City, and the vast sums of
money he lent the King to maintain the wars in France; and
how at a great Feast, to which he invited the King, the Queen,
and the Nobility, he generously burnt the writings and freely
forgave his Majesty the whole Debt. Tune of &#8216;Dainty, come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
thou to me.&#8217; London: Printed for R. Burton, at the Horse
Shoe in West Smithfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bulk of the ballad is the same as Richard Johnson&#8217;s,
but the following first stanza is added, the original first stanza
becoming the second:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Brave London Prentices,</div>
<div class="indent">Come listen to my song,</div>
<div class="verse">Tis for your glory all</div>
<div class="indent">And to you both belong.</div>
<div class="verse">And you poor country lads,</div>
<div class="indent">Though born of low degree,</div>
<div class="verse">See by God&#8217;s providence</div>
<div class="indent">What you in time may be.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The second half of the original seventh stanza, and the eighth,
ninth, and tenth stanzas, are left out.</p>

<p>Immediately before the last stanza the following one is
introduced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Let all kynde Citizens</div>
<div class="indent">Who do this story read,</div>
<div class="verse">By his example learn</div>
<div class="indent">Always the poor to feed.</div>
<div class="verse">What is lent to the poor</div>
<div class="indent">The Lord will sure repay,</div>
<div class="verse">And blessings keep in store</div>
<div class="indent">Until the latter day.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The other alterations are not many, and chiefly consist in
transpositions by which the rhymes are varied. This may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
seen by comparing with the original the Roxburghe version of
the last stanza which is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Lancashire, thou hast bred</div>
<div class="indent">This flower of charity;</div>
<div class="verse">Though he be dead and gone,</div>
<div class="indent">Yet lives his memory.</div>
<div class="verse">Those bells that call&#8217;d him so,</div>
<div class="indent">Turn again, Whittington,</div>
<div class="verse">Would they call may moe</div>
<div class="indent">Such men to fair London.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>At the end of one of the chap-books there is a version of the
ballad in which Lancashire is replaced by Somersetshire.</p>

<p>In the same volume of the <i>Roxburghe Ballads</i> (p. 470) is a
short version [1710?] containing a few only of the verses taken
from the ballad. It is illustrated with some woodcuts from
T. H.&#8217;s earlier <i>History</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have heard of Whittington and his cat, and others, that have
made fortunes by strange means.&#8221;&mdash;Parson&#8217;s <i>Wedding</i> (1664).</p></blockquote>

<p>Pepys went on September 21, 1668, to Southwark Fair,
&#8220;and there saw the puppet show of Whittington, which was
pretty to see.&#8221; He adds in his <i>Diary</i> &#8220;how that idle thing do
work upon people that see it, and even myself too.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the <i>Tatler</i> of September 13, 1709 (No. 67), is a list of
great men to be entered in the Temple of Fame, and in the subsequent
No. 78 is printed the following letter from a Citizen:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff, Sir, Your <i>Tatler</i> of September 13 I am
now reading, and in your list of famous men desire you not to forget
Alderman Whittington, who began the world with a cat, and
died worth three hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, which
he left to an only daughter three years after his mayoralty. If you
want any further particulars of ditto Alderman, daughter, or cat,
let me know, and per first will advise the needful, which concludes,
Your loving Friend, <span class="smcap">Lemuel Leger</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I am credibly informed that there was once a design of casting
into an opera the story of Whittington and his Cat, and that in
order to it there had been got together a great quantity of mice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
but Mr. Rich, the proprietor of the playhouse, very prudently considered
that it would be impossible for the cat to kill them all, and
that consequently the princes of the stage might be as much
infested with mice as the prince of the island was before the cat&#8217;s
arrival upon it; for which reason he would not permit it to be
acted in his house.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Spectator</i> (No. 5, March 6, 1711).</p></blockquote>

<p>The Rev. Samuel Pegge brought the subject of Whittington
and his Cat before a meeting of the Society of Antiquaries in
1771, but he could make nothing at all of the cat. There is
no record of the inquiry in the <i>Archaeologia</i>, but it is mentioned
in a letter from Gough to Tyson, 27 Dec. 1771 (Nichols&#8217;s
<i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol. viii. p. 575). Horace Walpole was
annoyed at the Society for criticising his &#8220;Richard III.&#8221;
and in his <i>Short Notes on his Life</i> he wrote&mdash;&#8220;Foote having
brought them on the stage for sitting in council, as they had
done on Whittington and his Cat, I was not sorry to find
them so ridiculous, or to mark their being so, and upon that
nonsense, and the laughter that accompanied it, I struck my
name out of their book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foote brought out his comedy of <i>The Nabob</i> at the Haymarket
Theatre in 1772. Sir Matthew Mite, the hero of the
piece, is elected a member of the Society of Antiquaries, and
delivers an address on Whittington and his Cat in which he
gave the following solution of the difficulty:&mdash;&#8220;The commerce
this worthy merchant carried on was chiefly confined to our
coasts. For this purpose he constructed a vessel which for its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
agility and lightness he aptly christened a cat. Nay, to this
our day, gentlemen, all our coals from Newcastle are imported
in nothing but cats. From thence it appears that it was not
the whiskered four-footed, mouse-killing cat that was the source
of the magistrate&#8217;s wealth, but the coasting, sailing, coal-carrying
cat; that, gentlemen, was Whittington&#8217;s cat.&#8221;</p>

<p>We may now pass from the fictitious to the real Richard
Whittington, and although this is not the place for a life of the
distinguished citizen, which may be found elsewhere, it will be
convenient to set down in order the chief incidents of his career.</p>

<p>Richard Whittington was the third son of Sir William
Whittington, knight, of Pauntley, Gloucestershire, and it is
assumed, by some writers, that he was born in or about the
year 1360. We must, however, place his birth at an earlier
date, for his name appears in the city <i>Letter Book</i>, H, fol. 110<i>a</i>,
(as Richard Whyttingdone), in the second year of Richard II.
(<small>A.D.</small> 1379), as a contributor of five marks towards a loan to
the city authorities; about four-fifths of the subscribers contributing
the same, which is the lowest figure among the
contributions.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> This is the first appearance of Whittington&#8217;s
name in the city books. William, the eldest son, succeeded to
the family property of Pauntley, but, dying without issue, the
estate went to Robert, the second son, who became high sheriff
of the county in 1402, and again in 1407. Pauntley remained
in the family as late as 1546.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>Nothing is known of Richard&#8217;s early life, either as to when
or how he came to London. He appears to have married
Alice, daughter of Hugh Fitzwarren, and probably he was
originally apprenticed to his father-in-law, whose name appears
in all the versions of his history.</p>

<p>The second appearance of Whittington&#8217;s name in the city
books is in 8 Richard II., when he was one of the eight
common councilmen for Coleman Street ward. In 11 Richard
II. he is named as becoming surety to the chamberlain in the
sum of ten pounds towards providing money for defence of
the city. In the following year he appears to have been no
longer a member for Coleman Street ward. On the 12th of
March, 1393, he is named as then chosen alderman of Broad
Street ward; and on 21st September of the same year he was
chosen by the mayor, William Staundon, one of the sheriffs for
the ensuing year.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>When Adam Bamme died in the year 1397, during his
mayoralty, Richard II. arbitrarily put Whittington in his place,
and at the lord mayor&#8217;s day of that year Whittington again
filled the office, being then regularly elected.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> From his will
we find that this king, who was a member of the Mercers&#8217;
Company, to which Whittington was apprenticed, was an
especial patron of his. In 1400 he was excused from attending
the Scottish wars, and in 1406 he was again elected mayor. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
rebuilt his parish church, and Mr. Riley has printed in his
valuable <i>Memorials</i> (p. 578) the grant by Whittington of land
for the re-building of the church of St. Michael, Paternoster,
&#8220;in the street called La Riole,&#8221; called after the merchants of La
Riole, a town near Bordeaux, who had established themselves
there.</p>

<p>Whittington was knighted by Henry V., and in 1419 he was
elected mayor for the fourth time. It was in this year that
John Carpenter commenced the compilation of his famous
<i>Liber Albus</i>. We see how highly this distinguished citizen was
appreciated from the writings of such men as Grafton and
Stow. Richard Grafton writes in his <i>Chronicle</i> (1569,
p. 433)&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;This yere (1406) a worthie citizen of London, named Rychard
Whittyngton, mercer and alderman, was elected maior of the sayde
citie, and bare that office three tymes. This worshipfull man so
bestowed his goodes and substaunce to the honor of God, to the
reliefe of the pore, and to the benefite of the comon weale, that he
hath right well deserved to be regestered in the boke of fame. First,
he erected one house or church in London to be a house of prayer,
and he named the same after his awne name Whittyngtons College,
and so it remayneth to this day. And in the same church, besydes
certeine priestes and clerkes, he placed a number of poore aged
men and women and buylded for them houses and lodgyngs, and
allowed unto them wood, cole, cloth, and weekly money to their
great reliefe and comfort.... He also buylded for the ease of
the maior of London and his brethren, and of the worshipfull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
citizens at the solempne dayes of their assemblye, a chapell adioining
to the Guyldhall, to the entent they should euer before they
entered into any of theyr affayrs first to go into the chappel, and by
prayer to call upon God for assistaunce.... He also buylded
a great part of the east ende of the Guildhall, besyde many other
good workes that I knowe not. But among all other I will shewe
unto you one very notable, which I receyved credibly by a writyng
of his awne hande, which also he willed to be fixed as a schedule
to his last will and testament, the contentes whereof was that he
willed and commaunded his executors as they would aunswere
before God at the day of the resurrection of all fleshe, that if they
found any debtor of his that ought to him any money, that if he
were not in their consciences well worth three tymes as much, and
also out of the debt of other men, and well able to pay, that then
they shoulde never demaund it, for he cleerely forgave it, and that
they should put no man in sute for any debt due to him. Looke
upon thys, ye aldermen, for it is a glorious glasse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Stow writes as follows in his <i>Survey of London</i> on some of
Whittington&#8217;s good works:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Richard Whittington, mercer, three times mayor, in the year
1421 began the library of the grey friars in London, to the charge
of four hundred pounds: his executors with his goods founded and
built Whittington College, with almshouses for thirteen poor men,
and divinity lectures to be read there for ever. They repaired St.
Bartholomew&#8217;s hospital in Smithfield; they bare half the charges of
building the library there, and they built the west gate of London,
of old time called Newgate,&#8221; &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>&#8220;The 1st year of Henry VI. John Coventrie and John Carpenter,
executors to Richard Whitington, gave towards the paving of this
great hall twenty pounds, and the next year fifteen pounds more,
to the said pavement, with hard stone of Purbeck; they also glazed
some windows thereof, and of the mayor&#8217;s court; on every which
windows the arms of Richard Whitington are placed.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Respecting the library at Guildhall, Stow, after relating how
the Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector, borrowed the books
and never returned them, writes:&mdash;&#8220;This library was built by
the executors of Richard Whittington and by William Burie;
the arms of Whittington are placed on the one side in the
stone work, and two letters, to wit W and B, for William
Burie, on the other side; it is now lofted through, and made a
storehouse for clothes.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>Whittington appears to have died childless, and in the
interesting picture of his deathbed, copied by Mr. Lysons from
an illumination in the ordinances of his college, his executors
are seen around his bed. His will was proved in 1423 by
John Coventry, John White, William Grove and John Carpenter.
The College of St. Spirit and St. Mary consisted of
a master, four fellows (masters of arts), clerks, conducts,
chorists, &amp;c. It was dissolved by Edward VI.; but the
memory of it remains in the name College Hill, Upper Thames
Street. God&#8217;s House or Hospital for thirteen poor men was
moved to Highgate in 1808.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>By his will Whittington directed that the inmates of his
college should pray for the souls of himself and his wife Alice,
of Sir William Whittington, and his wife Dame Joan, of
Hugh Fitzwarren and his wife Dame Malde, as well as for the
souls of Richard II. and Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of
Gloucester, &#8220;special lords and promoters of the said Whittington.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whittington&#8217;s epitaph is preserved by Stow and is in Latin;
yet the author of a <i>Life of Whittington</i> (1811) makes the
following misstatement:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Record, however, has handed down to us the original epitaph,
as it was cut on the monument of Sir Richard, by order of his
executors; and, exclusive of its connection with the subject of
these pages, it may be subjoined as a curious specimen of the poetry
of an age which was comparatively with the present so entirely
involved in the darkness of superstition and ignorance.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following extract from Granger&#8217;s <i>History of England</i> is
curious as showing that the public would not have a portrait of
Whittington without a representation of his famous cat:&mdash;</p>



<blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>&#8220;The true portraicture of Richard Whitington, thrise Lord
Maior of London; a vertuous and godly man, full of good works,
and those famous. He builded the gate of London called Newegate,
which before was a miserable doungeon. He builded Whitington
College, and made it an almose-house for poore people. Also
he builded a great parte of the hospitall of St. Bartholomew&#8217;s, in
West Smithfield, in London. He also builded the beautiful library
at the Grey Friars in London, called Christe&#8217;s Hospitall. He also
builded the Guildehalle chappell, and increased a great parte of
the east ende of the said halle, beside many other good workes.&#8221;&mdash;<i>R.
Elstracke sc. Collar of SS.; his right hand on a cat.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Granger says of this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;The cat has been inserted as the common people did not care
to buy the print without it. There was none originally in the
plate, but a skull in the place of the cat. I have seen only two
proofs of this portrait in its first state, and these were fine impressions.&#8221;&mdash;1775,
vol. i. p. 62.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Dick Whittington was a very little boy when his father and
mother died; little indeed, that he never knew them, nor the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span>
where he was born. He strolled about the country as ragged as a
colt, till he met with a waggoner who was going to London, and
who gave him leave to walk all the way by the side of his waggon
without paying anything for his passage, which pleased little
Whittington very much, as he wanted to see London sadly, for he
had heard that the streets were paved with gold, and he was willing
to get a bushel of it; but how great was his disappointment, poor
boy! when he saw the streets covered with dirt instead of gold,
and found himself in a strange place, without a friend, without food,
and without money.</p>

<p>Though the waggoner was so charitable as to let him walk up by
the side of the waggon for nothing, he took care not to know him
when he came to town, and the poor boy was, in a little time, so
cold and so hungry that he wished himself in a good kitchen and
by a warm fire in the country.</p>

<p>In this distress he asked charity of several people, and one of
them bid him &#8220;Go to work for an idle rogue.&#8221; &#8220;That I will,&#8221;
says Whittington, &#8220;with all my heart; I will work for you if you
will let me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man, who thought this favoured of wit and impertinence
(tho&#8217; the poor lad intended only to show his readiness to work),
gave him a blow with a stick which broke his head so that the blood
ran down. In this situation, and fainting for want of food, he laid
himself down at the door of one Mr. Fitzwarren, a merchant,
where the cook saw him, and, being an ill-natured hussey, ordered
him to go about his business or she would scald him. At this time
Mr. Fitzwarren came from the Exchange, and began also to scold
at the poor boy, bidding him to go to work.</p>

<p>Whittington answered that he should be glad to work if any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span>
body would employ him, and that he should be able if he could get
some victuals to eat, for he had had nothing for three days, and
he was a poor country boy, and knew nobody, and nobody would
employ him.</p>

<p>He then endeavoured to get up, but he was so very weak that
he fell down again, which excited so much compassion in the merchant
that he ordered the servants to take him in and give him
some meat and drink, and let him help the cook to do any dirty
work that she had to set him about. People are too apt to reproach
those who beg with being idle, but give themselves no concern to
put them in the way of getting business to do, or considering
whether they are able to do it, which is not charity.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent2">&#8220;Think of this ye affluent,</div>
<div class="verse">And when the overplus of your fortunes disturb</div>
<div class="verse">Your minds, think how little stops the lash of penury,</div>
<div class="verse">And makes the wretched happy!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>I remember a circumstance of this sort, which Sir William
Thompson told my father with tears in his eyes, and it is so affecting
that I shall never forget it:</p>


<p class="center"><span class="large">STORY</span><br />
OF<br />
<span class="xlarge">SIR WILLIAM THOMPSON.</span></p>



<p>&#8220;When Sir William Thompson was in the plantation abroad,
one of his friends told him he had an indentured servant whom
he had just bought, that was his countryman and a lusty man;
&#8216;but he is so idle,&#8217; says he, &#8216;that I cannot get him to work.&#8217; &#8216;Aye,&#8217;
says Sir William, &#8216;let me see him.&#8217; Accordingly they walked out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span>
together and found the man sitting on a heap of stones. Upon
this Sir William, after enquiring about his country, asked why he
did not go out to work. &#8216;I am not able,&#8217; answered the man.
&#8216;Not able?&#8217; says Sir William, &#8216;I am sure you look very well; give
him a few stripes.&#8217; Upon this the planter struck him several times,
but the poor man still kept his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they left him to look over the plantation, exclaiming
against his obstinacy all the way they went; but how surprised
were they, on their return, to find the poor man fallen from off
the place where he had been sitting, and dead! &#8216;The cruelty,&#8217;
says Sir William, &#8216;of my ordering the poor man to be beaten while
in the agonies of death lies always next my heart. It is what I
shall never forget, and will for ever prevent my judging rashly of
people who appear in distress. How do we know what our children
may come to? The Lord have mercy upon the poor, and defend
them from the proud, the inconsiderate, and the avaricious.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>But we return to Whittington: who would have lived happy in
this worthy family had he not been bumped about by the cross
cook, who must be always roasting or basting, and when the spit
was still employed her hands upon poor Whittington! &#8217;till Miss
Alice, his master&#8217;s daughter, was informed of it, and then she took
compassion on the poor boy, and made the servants treat him
kindly.</p>

<p>Besides the crossness of the cook, Whittington had another
difficulty to get over before he could be happy. He had, by order
of his master, a flock-bed placed for him in a garret, where there
were such a number of rats and mice that often ran over the poor
boy&#8217;s nose and disturbed him in his sleep. After some time, however,
a gentleman, who came to his master&#8217;s house, gave Whittington<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
a penny for brushing his shoes. This he put into his pocket,
being determined to lay it out to the best advantage; and the next
day, seeing a woman in the street with a cat under her arm, he ran
up to know the price of it. The woman (as the cat was a good
mouser) asked a deal of money for it, but on Whittington&#8217;s telling
her he had but a penny in the world, and that he wanted a cat
sadly, she let him have it.</p>

<p>This cat Whittington concealed in the garret, for fear she should
be beat about by his mortal enemy the cook, and here she soon
killed or frightened away the rats and mice, so that the poor boy
could now sleep as sound as a top.</p>

<p>Soon after this the merchant, who had a ship ready to sail, called
for his servants, as his custom was, in order that each of them
might venture something to try their luck; and whatever they sent
was to pay neither freight nor custom, for he thought justly that
God Almighty would bless him the more for his readiness to let the
poor partake of his fortune. &#8220;He that giveth to the poor lendeth
to the Lord, who will return it seventy-fold.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the servants appeared but poor Whittington, who, having
neither money nor goods, could not think of sending anything to
try his luck; but his good friend Miss Alice, thinking his poverty
kept him away, ordered him to be called.</p>

<p>She then offered to lay down something for him, but the merchant
told his daughter that would not do, it must be something
of his own. Upon which poor Whittington said he had nothing
but a cat which he bought for a penny that was given him. &#8220;Fetch
thy cat, boy,&#8221; said the merchant, &#8220;and send her.&#8221; Whittington
brought poor puss and delivered her to the captain, with tears in
his eyes, for he said he should now be disturbed by the rats and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span>
mice as much as ever. All the company laughed at the adventure
but Miss Alice, who pitied the poor boy, and gave him something
to buy another cat.</p>

<p>While puss was beating the billows at sea, poor Whittington was
severely beaten at home by his tyrannical mistress the cook, who
used him so cruelly, and made such game of him for sending his
cat to sea, that at last the poor boy determined to run away from
his place, and, having packed up the few things he had, he set out
very early in the morning on All-Hallows day. He travelled as
far as Holloway, and there sat down on a stone to consider what
course he should take; but while he was thus ruminating, Bow
bells, of which there were only six, began to ring; and he thought
their sounds addressed him in this manner:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Turn again, Whittington,</div>
<div class="verse">Lord Mayor of great London.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8220;Lord Mayor of London!&#8221; said he to himself; &#8220;what would not
one endure to be Lord Mayor of London, and ride in such a fine
coach? Well, I&#8217;ll go back again, and bear all the pummelling and
ill-usage of Cicely rather than miss the opportunity of being Lord
Mayor!&#8221; So home he went, and happily got into the house and
about his business before Mrs. Cicely made her appearance.</p>

<p>We must now follow Miss Puss to the coast of Africa, to that
coast where Dido expired for loss of Ænus (<i>sic</i>). How perilous
are voyages at sea, how uncertain the winds and the waves, and
how many accidents attend a naval life!</p>

<p>The ship, which had the cat on board, was long beaten at sea,
and at last, by contrary winds, driven on a part of the coast of
Barbary which was inhabited by Moors, unknown to the English.
These people received our countrymen with civility, and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span>
the captain, in order to trade with them, shewed them the patterns
of the goods he had on board, and sent some of them to the king
of the country, who was so well pleased that he sent for the captain
and the factor to his palace, which was about a mile from the sea.
Here they were placed, according to the custom of the country, on
rich carpets, flowered with gold and silver; and the king and queen
being seated at the upper end of the room, dinner was brought in,
which consisted of many dishes; but no sooner were the dishes
put down but an amazing number of rats and mice came from all
quarters, and devoured all the meat in an instant. The factor, in
surprise, turned round to the nobles and asked &#8220;If these vermin
were not offensive?&#8221; &#8220;O yes,&#8221; said they, &#8220;very offensive; and
the king would give half his treasure to be freed of them, for they
not only destroy his dinner, as you see, but they assault him in his
chamber, and even in bed, so that he is obliged to be watched
while he is sleeping for fear of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The factor jumped for joy; he remembered poor Whittington
and his cat, and told the king he had a creature on board the ship
that would despatch all these vermin immediately. The king&#8217;s
heart heaved so high at the joy which this news gave him that his
turban dropped off his head. &#8220;Bring this creature to me,&#8221; says he;
&#8220;vermin are dreadful in a court, and if she will perform what you
say, I will load your ship with gold and jewels in exchange for
her.&#8221; The factor, who knew his business, took this opportunity
to set forth the merits of Miss Puss. He told his majesty &#8220;That
it would be inconvenient to part with her, as, when she was gone,
the rats and mice might destroy the goods in the ship&mdash;but to
oblige his majesty he would fetch her.&#8221; &#8220;Run, run,&#8221; said the
queen; &#8220;I am impatient to see the dear creature.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>Away flew the factor, while another dinner was providing, and
returned with the cat just as the rats and mice were devouring that
also. He immediately put down Mrs. Puss, who killed a great
number of them.</p>

<p>The king rejoiced greatly to see his old enemies destroyed by
so small a creature, and the queen was highly pleased, and desired
the cat might be brought near that she might look at her. Upon
which the factor called &#8220;Pussy, pussy, pussy,&#8221; and she came to
him. He then presented her to the queen, who started back, and
was afraid to touch a creature who had made such a havoc among
the rats and mice; however, when the factor stroked the cat and
called &#8220;Pussy, pussy,&#8221; the queen also touched her and cried &#8220;Putty,
putty,&#8221; for she had not learned English.</p>

<p>He then put her down on the queen&#8217;s lap, where she, purring,
played with her majesty&#8217;s hand, and then sung herself to sleep.</p>

<p>The king having seen the exploits of Mrs. Puss, and being
informed that she was with young, and would stock the whole
country, bargained with the captain and factor for the whole ship&#8217;s
cargo, and then gave them ten times as much for the cat as all the
rest amounted to. With which, taking leave of their majesties,
and other great personages at court, they sailed with a fair wind for
England, whither we must now attend them.</p>

<p>The morn had scarcely dawned when Mr. Fitzwarren stole from
the bed of his beloved wife, to count over the cash, and settle the
business for that day. He had just entered the compting-house,
and seated himself at the desk, when somebody came, tap, tap, at
the door. &#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; says Mr. Fitzwarren. &#8220;A friend,&#8221;
answered the other. &#8220;What friend can come at this unseasonable
time?&#8221; &#8220;A real friend is never unseasonable,&#8221; answered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span>
other. &#8220;I come to bring you good news of your ship <i>Unicorn</i>.&#8221;
The merchant bustled up in such an hurry that he forgot his gout;
instantly opened the door, and who should be seen waiting but the
captain and factor, with a cabinet of jewels, and a bill of lading, for
which the merchant lifted up his eyes and thanked heaven for
sending him such a prosperous voyage. Then they told him the
adventures of the cat, and shewed him the cabinet of jewels which
they had brought for Mr. Whittington. Upon which he cried out
with great earnestness, but not in the most poetical manner,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse1">&#8220;Go, send him in, and tell him of his fame,</div>
<div class="verse">And call him Mr. Whittington by name.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>

<p>It is not our business to animadvert upon these lines; we are
not critics, but historians. It is sufficient for us that they are the
words of Mr. Fitzwarren; and though it is beside our purpose, and
perhaps not in our power to prove him a good poet, we shall soon
convince the reader that he was a good man, which was a much
better character; for when some, who were present, told him that
this treasure was too much for such a poor boy as Whittington, he
said, &#8220;God forbid that I should deprive him of a penny; it is his
own, and he shall have it to a farthing.&#8221; He then ordered Mr.
Whittington in, who was at this time cleaning the kitchen, and
would have excused himself from going into the compting-house,
saying, the room was rubbed, and his shoes were dirty and full of
hob-nails. The merchant, however, made him come in, and
ordered a chair to be set for him. Upon which, thinking they
intended to make sport of him, as had been too often the case in
the kitchen, he besought his master not to mock a poor simple
fellow, who intended them no harm, but let him go about his
business. The merchant, taking him by the hand, said, &#8220;Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span>
Mr. Whittington, I am in earnest with you, and sent for you to
congratulate you on your great success. Your cat has procured
you more money than I am worth in the world, and may you long
enjoy it and be happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length, being shown the treasure, and convinced by them
that all of it belonged to him, he fell upon his knees and thanked
the Almighty for his providential care of such a poor and miserable
creature. He then laid all the treasure at his master&#8217;s feet, who
refused to take any part of it, but told him he heartily rejoiced at
his prosperity, and hoped the wealth he had acquired would be a
comfort to him, and would make him happy. He then applied to
his mistress, and to his good friend Miss Alice, who refused to
take any part of the money, but told him she heartily rejoiced at
his good success, and wished him all imaginable felicity. He then
gratified the captain, factor, and the ship&#8217;s crew, for the care they
had taken of his cargo. He likewise distributed presents to all
the servants in the house, not forgetting even his old enemy the
cook, though she little deserved it.</p>

<p>After this Mr. Fitzwarren advised Mr. Whittington to send for
the necessary people and dress himself like a gentleman, and made
him the offer of his house to live in till he could provide himself
with a better.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass that when Mr. Whittington&#8217;s face was
washed, his hair curled, and dressed in a rich suit of clothes, that
he turned out a genteel young fellow; and, as wealth contributes
much to give a man confidence, he in a little time dropped that
sheepish behaviour which was principally occasioned by a depression
of spirits, and soon grew a sprightly and good companion,
insomuch that Miss Alice, who had formerly seen him with an eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span>
of compassion, now viewed him with other eyes, which perhaps
was in some measure occasioned by his readiness to oblige her, and
by continually making her presents of such things that he thought
would be most agreeable.</p>

<p>When her father perceived they had this good liking for each
other he proposed a match between them, to which both parties
cheerfully consented, and the Lord Mayor, Court of Aldermen,
Sheriffs, the Company of Stationers, and a number of eminent
merchants attended the ceremony, and were elegantly treated at an
entertainment made for that purpose.</p>

<p>History further relates that they lived very happy, had several
children, and died at a good old age. Mr. Whittington served
Sheriff of London in the year 1340, and was three times Lord
Mayor. In the last year of his mayoralty he entertained King
Henry V. and his Queen, after his conquest of France, upon which
occasion the King, in consideration of Whittington&#8217;s merit, said,
&#8220;Never had prince such a subject;&#8221; which being told to Whittington
at the table, he replied &#8220;Never had subject such a king.&#8221;
His Majesty, out of respect to his good character, conferred the
honour of knighthood on him soon after.</p>

<p>Sir Richard many years before his death constantly fed a great
number of poor citizens, built a church and a college to it, with a
yearly allowance for poor scholars, and near it erected an hospital.
He also built Newgate for criminals, and gave liberally to St.
Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital and other public charities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two old houses in London, which were pulled down at the
beginning of the present century, have been associated with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span>
name of Whittington, but there is no evidence that he really
dwelt in either of them. One ruinous building in Sweedon&#8217;s
Passage, Grub Street, engravings of which will be found in
J. T. Smith&#8217;s <i>Topography of London</i>, was pulled down in 1805,
and five houses built on its site. A tablet was then set up, on
which was an inscription to the effect that the house had been
called Gresham House, and that Whittington once inhabited it.</p>

<p>The magnificent house which stood in Hart Street, Crutched
Friars, a few doors from Mark Lane, is said to have been called
Whittington&#8217;s palace in the old leases, but this is the only
evidence in favour of the popular belief. The front was
elaborately carved in oak, the work of a much later date than
that of Whittington. The decoration is attributed to the latter
part of the reign of Henry VIII., and on the ceiling among
other forms was that of a cat&#8217;s head, from which possibly the
tradition of its having been the residence of Whittington arose.
There was a popular superstition that the cat&#8217;s eyes followed
the visitor as he walked about the room. This house was taken
down in 1801, but both it and the house in Sweedon&#8217;s Passage
were reproduced in the interesting Old London Street at the
International Health Exhibition of 1884.</p>

<p>Courteous Reader,&mdash;I here present unto thee no strange
or forreign news, no imagination, or vain conceit of poetical
fiction; neither do I tell thee of Gallagantua or of the Red
Rose Knight, nor such like stories; but I here offer to thy
view a true pattern of humility; being the glory of our Kingdom,
and raised to Honour by desert; the title tells you that
it is the life and death of Richard Whittington, who for his
clemency and understanding was three times chosen Lord
Mayor of the Honourable City of London, who always
acknowledged his beginning to be of mean and low rank; yet
he was beloved of the King for his fidelity and trust, as may
appear in larger volumes, and the entertainment that he gave
at his own house to his Soveraign at several times: his bounty
upon all occasions, when the King wanted his purse; his love
to the City and Commons; which are not to be buried in
oblivion, but rather to be proclaimed as living monuments to
all people of what condition soever, to animate them never to
be dejected though never so poor, as the story will more at
large declare; all which happened in the days of our forefathers,
and very probable it may be for us to believe; if we will not
give credit to former historians who will give the like to us in
future ages: read it through, and you will find something
worthy of note, and thou shall do thy self some pleasure and
me a high favour. <i>Vale.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>The Life and Death of Sir Richard Whittington;<br />
who was three times Lord Mayor of the<br />
City of London.</i></h2></div>


<p>The saying is not so old as true, He that refuseth to buy
counsel cheap shall buy repentance dear; neither let any work
[mock?] a man in his misery, but rather beware by him how
to avoid the like misfortune; if thou intend to do any good,
defer it not till the next day, for thou knowest not what may
happen over night to prevent thee. Behold thyself in a looking
glass, if thou appearest beautiful do such things as may become
thy beauty; but if thou seem foul or deformed, let the actions
of thy life make good that splendor which thy face lacketh.
Tell not thy mind to every man, make thy self indebted to no
man, be friend to few men, be courteous to all men, let thy wit
be thy friend, thy mind thy companion, thy tongue thy servant,
let vertue be thy life, valour thy love, honour thy fame and
heaven thy felicity. These (Reader) be good documents for
thee to follow, and I am now to present thee with a worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
president to imitate; observe his beginning, forget not the
middle passage of his life, and thou wilt no question crown his
head. He that made all things of nothing can of a little make
much, and multiply a mite into a magazine, as will easily
appear by the succeeding history.</p>

<p>This Richard Whittington was so obscurely born that he
could scarcely give account of his parents or kindred, and being
almost starved in the country, necessity compelled him up to
London, hoping to find more charity in the town than in the
country: to beg he was ashamed, to steal he did abhor: two
days he spent in gaping upon the shops and gazing upon the
buildings feeding his eyes but starving his stomach. At length
meer faintness compell&#8217;d him to rest himself upon a bench
before a merchant&#8217;s gate, where he not long sat but the owner
of the house having occasion of business into the town finding
him a poor simple fellow, and thinking that he had no more
within him than appeared without, demanded of him why he
loytered there, and being able to work for his living did not
apply himself unto some lawful calling, threatning him at the
first with the stocks and the whipping-post; but the poor man,
after the making of some plain leggs and courtesie, desired him
to pardon him, and told him that he was a dejected man, who
desired any imployment, and that no pains how mean or course
(<i>sic</i>) soever could seem tedious or burthensome unto him, so he
might but find some good master, by whose charity he might
relieve his present necessity: for his great ambition was but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
keep his body from nakedness and his stomach from hunger,
and told him withal how long it was since he had tasted meat
or drink.</p>

<p>The worthy merchant seeing him of a personable body, and
an ingenious aspect howsoever both were clouded under a
rustick habit, began somewhat to commiserate his estate, and
knocking for a servant had him take in that fellow and give
him such victuals as the house for the present afforded, and at
his return he would have further conference with him. The
servant did as he was commanded and took him in.</p>

<p>The merchant went then to the Exchange, which was then
in Lumber Street, about his affairs; in which intrim (<i>sic</i>) poor
Whittington was hied into the kitchin to warm himself, for
faintness by reason of hunger and cold (for it was then in the
winter time) had quite rob&#8217;d him of his colour. Meat was set
before him in plenty, and being bred in the country, as the
proverb goeth, <i>He fed like a farmer</i>, and having satisfied himself
sufficiently and warm&#8217;d him to the full, a fresh colour began
to come into his cheeks: at which the Merchant&#8217;s daughter
(hearing of a new come guest) came into the kitchin, and began
to question him of divers things concerning the country, to all
which he gave her such modest and sensible answers that she
took a great liking unto him, and so left him.</p>

<p>Dinner time came, and Master Fitzwarren (for so was the
merchant called) came home with a good stomach, and brought
a friend or two with him from the Exchange; down they sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to meat, and had speech of many things at the table; meanwhile
the servants were set also at dinner, who would needs have
Whittington, though he had so lately broke his fast, to keep
them company, some of them delighting in his country speech,
others deriding his supposed simplicity.</p>

<p>But to come to the purpose, the table being withdrawn in
the parlour, and the guests departed, and Master Fitzwarren
and his daughter left alone, she being of a good and gentle
disposition, began to commend his charity concerning the poor
man whom he relieved that morning, to whom he answered,
God-a-mercy daughter, thou hast done well to remember me,
such a one I sent indeed, but have my servants done as I commanded
them? and where is he now? who answered him, that
she had given order he should stay dinner, and not depart the
house till he himself had further spoken with him. At which
they both went unto the Hall, and called the fellow before
them; who appeared unto them with such a bashful humility
that it seemed to them both to beg a charity; some language
past betwixt them concerning him, which gave them content;
at length they bid him retire himself.</p>

<p>When the father and the daughter had some private conference
concerning him she urged him to entertain him into
his house, and that there would be some employment for him,
either to run or to go of errands or else to do some drudgery
in the kitchin, as making of fires, scouring kettles, turning the
spit, and the like: To whom the father reply&#8217;d that indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
his work might be worth his meat, but he had no lodging to
spare, and she again answered that there were garrets in the
house that were put to no use at all, and in one of them he
might conveniently be lodged and put the house to no trouble
at all.</p>

<p>Well at length he was admitted, and made a member of the
family, in which he demeaned himself so well by his willingness
to run or go or do any service how mean so ever that he had
got the good will of all the whole houshold, only the kitchin
maid being a curst quean, and knowing him to be an under
servant to her, domineered over him and used him very coursely
and roughly, of which he would never complain, though he had
cause enough. The garret in which he lay, by reason it had
been long unfrequented, was troubled with rats and mice, insomuch
that he could not sleep in the night but they ran over his
face, and much disturb&#8217;d him in his rest: to prevent which
having got a penny either for going of an errand, or for making
clean boots or shooes or the like, with that he bought a young
cat which he kept in his garret, and whatsoever he had from
the reversion of the servants table he would be sure to reserve
part for her, because he had found by experience that she had
rid him of the former inconveniences.</p>

<p>The History tells us that this merchant, Master Hugh Fitzwarren,
was so generous that he never adventured any ship to
sea but he would have his daughter, his cashire, and every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of his servants, whar (<i>sic</i>) or whatsoever, to put in something,
and to adventure with him, and according to that proportion
which they could spare, every one received to a token at the
return of the ship. His daughter she began, the rest followed,
and the servants borrowed out of their wages everyone according
to their abilities, and when they all had done Whittington was
remembered and called for, and his master telling him the
custome of his home, asked him what he had to hazard in this
adventure, who replyed again, he was a poor man, and had
nothing in the world saving the cloaths upon his back, but for
money he had none at all: then his daughter drew out her
purse and told her father, that for his servant Whittington she
would lay down whatsoever he would desire. Who answered
again, that what she had spoke was nothing to the purpose;
for whatsoever was ventured in that kind must be out of ones
proper goods and chattels, and again demanded of him if he had
anything he could call his own to put to hazard, and charged
him deeply concerning that point, who making some unnecessary
leggs, told him that he had nothing which he could call
his saving a cat, which he had bought with his penny, which he
could not spare because she had done him so many good offices,
and told them every circumstance before related, which when
the merchant heard he told him that he should venture that
commodity and none else, and charged him to fetch her instantly
(for the ship which was called the Unicorn) was fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
down as low as Blackwal and all their lading was already had
aboard. Whittington although unwilling to part from so good
a companion yet being forced by his masters command by whom
he had his subsistence he brought her and (not without tears)
delivered her to his factor who was partly glad of her, by reason
they were troubled with mice and rats in the ship, which not
only spoyled their victuals but damaged their wares and commodities.</p>

<p>I must leave the cat upon her voyage at sea and honest
Whittington on land, who by that cursed quean the kitchin
maid was so beaten and abused that he was as weary of his
life as of his service: for she (usurping upon his plainness and
modesty) would be quarrelling with him, upon every small or
no occasion at all; sometimes beating him with the broom,
sometimes laying him over the shoulders with a laddle, the spit
or what came next to her hands, being of so dogged a disposition
that she still continued her cruelty towards him, and
therefore he resolved with himself to run away, and for that
purpose he had bundled up those few clothes which he had,
and before day broke was got as far as Bunhill, and then he
sat down to consider with himself what course he were best
to take; where by chance (it being all-hallows day) a merry
peal from Bow Church began to ring, and as he apprehended
they were tun&#8217;d to this ditty,&mdash;</p>

<div class="verse">Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London.</div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>This took such a great impression in him, that finding how
early it was, and that he might yet come back in his masters
house before any of the family were stirring, he resolved to go
back, and found every thing according to his own wishes and
desires, insomuch that when the household were up none
could challenge him to have been missing. And thus he continued
as before in his first plainness and honesty, well beloved
of all save the kitchin drudge; I come now to tell you what
became of his adventure.</p>

<p>It so hapned that this goodly ship Unicorn was by contrary
gusts and bad weather driven upon the utmost coast of Barbary,
where never any Englishman (or scarce any Christian) had
ever traded before, where they showed their commodities and
offered them to be vended. The Moors came down in multitudes,
much taken with the beauty of their ship, for they had
never seen any of that bigness or burthen before, but when
they had taken a serious view of their commodities as hatchets,
knives and looking-glasses, fish-hooks, &amp;c. but especially their
cloth and kersies of several sizes and colours, they brought
them gold in abundance for it was more plentiful with them
then (<i>sic</i>) lead or copper with us.</p>

<p>Presently the news was carryed to the king who sent some
of his chief nobility to bring him some sorts of every commodity
that was aboard, which when he saw they pleased him
highly, sending for the master and merchants factor to court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
He at their own rate bargained with them for their whole
lading, nor would he suffer them to depart till he had feasted
them royally.</p>

<p>Now the fashion of the Moors is not to sit at the table as
the custom is among us, but to have a rich carpet spread upon
the ground, and when the meal or banquet is served in, as
well the king himself as the rest sit round about cross-legg&#8217;d
as taylors commonly used to do upon their shop-boards, and
in that manner our English are set at the king&#8217;s banquet, but
the meal was no sooner served in but swarms of rats and mice
seized upon the dishes, and snatched away the meat even from
the king and queen&#8217;s trenchers: at which the factor being
annoyed asked one of the nobility (by an interpreter) if they
preserved those vermin for sport, or if they were noysome, and
troublesome unto them: who answered him again, that they
were the greatest vexation unto them that could be possible,
and by reason of their multitudes they could not be destroyed,
but the king would willingly give half the revenue of his crown
if he could but only clear the court of them, for not only his
table but his very bed-chamber swarmed with them, insomuch
that he durst not lay him down to rest without a watch about
him, to keep them off his pillow: To whom the factor replyed,
that they had a strange beast aboard which he made no doubt
would rid them of those vermine: which being told the king
he rose from his place and imbracing the factor told him if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
could shew him such a creature he would ballast his vessel
with silver and lade her with gold and pearl. Who apprehending
the occasion made very coy of the business, telling him
it was a creature of great value and not common. Besides
they could not spare her from the ship, in regard when they
were asleep yet she was still waking in the night, not only to
preserve their merchandise but there dyet from the like spoyl.
The more dainty that he made of the matter the more earnest
was the king for this beast, insomuch that he was presently
sent for.</p>

<p>And a second feast being prepared and the rats and mice
appearing as they did before, the young merchant having the
cat under his cloak the king desired to see the thing which he
had before so much commended; when presently he discovered
her, and cast her among them; she no sooner saw these
vermine but fell upon them with such a fury that here lay
one panting, there another quite dead; nor left them till she
had frighted and disperst the whole number, but such as she
seized their carkasses lay there as witnesses of their unexpected
slaughter.</p>

<p>Great pleasure took the king and the nobility in the sport,
vowing that the hunting of the lyon (of which there was plenty
in that country) was not answerable unto it. In the interim
one began to praise her for her colour, another commending
her for her valour, one said she had the countenance of a lyon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and every one gave his sentence. When the poor cat finding
no more work for her to do, went round to the King and
Queen purling and curling (as their manner is), which they
apprehended to be, as if she inquired of them what she had
deserved for that late service.</p>

<p>To cut off circumstance, no price could part them, and the
rather when the factor had told the king that she was with
kittens, and that her brood would in some few years, being
carefully lookt into, furnish the whole kingdom, so that
Whittingtons cats adventure only surmounted all the ships
lading beside, with which fortune and unexpected gain we
bring them safe into England; the ship lying at anchor near
Blackwal, and the Pilot and Cape-merchant, with some other
officers in the ship at Mr. Fitzwarrens house, which was by
Leaden-Hall, to give accompt of their voyage. But these
caskets of jewels and pearls, with other unvaluable (<i>sic</i>) riches
which were given for the cat, they caused to be brought along,
not daring, by reason of their inestimable value, to trust them
in the ship. The Bills of lading and the benefit of the return
of the Commodities being viewed and considered of by the
owner, he praised God for so prosperous a voyage, and called
all his servants and gave order that according to their adventures
every one should receive his portion.</p>

<p>At length casting his eye upon those rich caskets and cabinets,
he asked to whose share they belonged; who whispered him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the ear, and told him to his poor Whittington, relating every
particular as is before discoursed. To whom Master Fitzwarren
replyed, if they then be his, God forbid I should keep
from him the least farthing that is his right, and presently
commanded Whittington to be sent for by the name of Mr.
Whittington.</p>

<p>The servants not knowing anything of the business, went
unto him into the kitchin, where he was then rubbing the spits,
scouring the kettles, and making clean the dressers, and told him
he must come to his Master presently into the parlor. The
poor man excused himself, that his shooes were dirty and the
room was rubb&#8217;d, and if he should but touch any thing there
he should spoyl and deface those things in the room. But still
the master of the House called for Master Whittington, sending
one servant after another till he was brought before him; and
having scraped some few legs, instantly his master took him by
the hand, and called for a chair for Master Whittington, his
daughter, the pilot, and the factor, every one of them saluted
him by the name of Mr. Whittington and forced him to sit
down. He wondering what this should mean desired them not
to mock a poor simple man who meant none any harm, &amp;c.
and wept (the tears dropping from his eyes), desiring them not
to deride his poverty, for his ambition was never to come so
high as from the kitchin to the hall much more from the hall
to the parlor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>Then came his master to him seriously and said, Indeed Mr.
Whittington, we are all in very good earnest, for you are at
this time a better man than myself in estate, and then shewed
him all those cabinets and caskets, and how richly they were
lined.</p>

<p>When he perceived by all their earnest asservations that all
was true he first fell down upon his knees and gave God most
hearty thanks, who out of his great bounty would vouchsafe
to cast an eye upon so poor and wretched a creature as
himself; then turning to his master he presented all his riches
before him and told him that all he had was at his disposing
and service, who answered him again, that for his own part
God had sent him sufficient of his own, neither would he take
from him the value of one Barbary ducket. He came nere and
with a low leg saluted his mistris, and told her that when she
pleased to make choice of a husband he would make her the
richest marriage in London, because she was so willing out of
her own purse (when he was altogether penniless) to lay out
for his adventure. To the pilot, and master, and every officer,
and common saylor he gave liberal according to their degree,
even to the ship boy, and then to every servant of the house,
nay to the very kitchin wench who was so churlish unto him,
and had so often basted him instead of her roast meats; having
caused her to be called unto him he gave her an hundred pounds
towards her marriage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>This being done, taylors were sent for, sempsters and the
like to put him into cloaths and linnen of the best, who were
to accommodate him with all speed possible, and his lodging in
the garret was chang&#8217;d into the best chamber of the house.
And when the barber had been with him and the rest to make
him compleat in his habit, there was a strange and sudden
metamorphosis; for out of a smoky and dirty kitchin-drudge
there appeared a proper and well-proportioned man, and gentile
merchant, in so much that his young mistris began to cast a
more amorous eye upon him than before, which not a little
pleased Master Fitzwarren her father, who intended a match
betwixt them.</p>

<p>The brute of this great adventure was presently revised
through the whole city, insomuch that his master intreated his
late servant to walk with him into the Exchange to see the
fashion of the merchants, which he did, when all of them came
about him and saluted him, some bid God give him joy of his
fortune, others desired of him better and further acquaintance,
and every one as his several fancy led him: some commended
him for his person, others for his modest answers and discreet
carriage. Indeed, wealth is able to make all these good where
they are most wanting, which was not in him as appears by the
sequel.</p>

<p>Within few weeks the match was propounded betwixt Master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Whittington and Mistris Alice, and willingly entertained by
both parties and not without great cost, with the invitation of
the Lord Mayor and the Aldermen very nobly celebrated, and
the bridegroom by this means had got acquaintances with the
best.</p>

<p>After this his father-in-law demanded of his son what he purposed
to take in hand (his freedom being offered him). Who
made answer again that since God had so blest him in his small
adventure he would not leave it of so, but prove his goodness
in a greater, and that his purpose was to turn merchant, which
reply gave him no small content in regard he knew the best
among them would be glad to have the society of so hopeful a
citizen, which he continued adventuring in divers bottoms with
his father, and had very happy and prosperous returns.</p>

<p>The time being come when he was prickt for Sheriff he
modestly refused it as unable to take so great a charge, and
would willingly have paid his fine, which his father-in-law
would not suffer, at whose persuasion he took the place upon
him, in which he so well behaved himself in the management
of all affairs belonging to his office that he not only left it without
the least taxation, but with a general love and approbation,
insomuch that the universal eye of the whole city was fixt upon
him in an hopeful expectation what a profitable member of
that united body he might futurely prove, and this hapned
in the year of our Lord 1493, Sir John Hodley grocer being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
mayor and Drewerie Barentine his fellow Sheriff, of the truth
of which Mr. Fabian in his <i>Chronicle</i> and Mr. John Stow in his
<i>Survey of London</i> can fully satisfie you.</p>

<p>In the year 1497 and the one and twentieth of the same Kings
reign, Sir Richard Whittington was Lord Mayor of London,
John Woodcok and William Askam being Sheriffs, and he
held the place with great reputation and honour. In which
time of his Mayoralty there was much discontent in the kingdom,
by reason of many differences betwixt the King and the
Commons; the circumstances whereof were here too long to
relate, only one thing is worthy of observation that whether by
his adventures or no may it be questioned, bringing in yearly
such store of gold, silks, sattins, velvets, damasks, stones, and
jewels, &amp;c. into the kingdom might be the cause of that great
pride and rioting in apparel which was used in those days. But
as Harding, Fabian, and others have left to me how in that year
of his Mayoralty and after there resorted to the Kings Court at
their pleasures daily, at the least ten thousand persons. In his
kitchin were three hundred servitors, and in every office according
to that rate. Moreover of ladies, chambermaids, and
laundresses about three hundred, and they all exceeded in
gorgeous and costly apparel far above their degrees; for even
the yeomen and grooms were clothed in silks and velvets,
damasks, and the like, with imbroydery, rich furs, and goldsmiths
work, devising very strange and new fashions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>And in this year also, about the feast of St. Bartholomew,
grew a great discord betwixt the Duke of Hereford and Mowbery,
Duke of Norfolk, the beginning thereof being as followeth:
The two Dukes riding from the Parliament towards their
lodgings, the Duke of Norfolk said to the other, Sir, you see
how variable the King is in his words, and (reflecting upon what
had past) how without mercy he putteth his Lords and kinsfolks
to death, imprisoning some and exciting others. Therefore
it behoveth us not too much to trust to his fair and smooth
language, for doubtless in time he will bring even to us the like
death and destruction. Of which words he accused him to the
King, which the other denying it was to be tryed by combate.
The lists were appointed and the day of meeting the eleventh
day of September, to which place and on the day assigned came
both the Dukes and bravely accoutred, appeared before the
King ready to enter into battel; when the King threw down
his warder, and staying the combate banished the Duke of
Hereford for ten years, but the Duke of Norfolk for ever, was
travelling many countries, at the last came to Venice and then
ended his life.</p>

<p>Again in 1406, and in the eighth of Henry the fourth, Sir
Richard Whittington was the second time Lord Mayor,
Nicholas Worton and Geffery Brook being Sheriffs. Again in
the year 1409, being the seventh year of Henry the fifth, he
supplyed the Pretorship, Robert Whittington (his near Kinsman)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
and John Butler being Sheriffs, and which is more
remarkable of him then of any other that ever preceded him in
that place of honour, he was once Sheriff and three times Lord
Mayor of this famous and honourable City in three several
Kings reigns.</p>

<p>Now to cut off all circumstances and come close to the
matter, we may easily find what this man was, by the pious
and religious acts done in his life to the Cities present grace,
use and benefit, and to his own blessed memory for ever.</p>

<p>In the Vintry-ward he built a church and dedicated it to S.
Michael calling it Pater Noster in the Royal, and added to it
a Colledge founded to St. Mary, and placed therein a President
and four fellows which ought to be masters of arts, besides
other yearly allowance to clerks and young schollars, near which
he erected an Hospital which he called God&#8217;s house, for thirteen
poor men, and there according to the devout superstition
of those days were to pray for the souls of his father-in-law
Hugh Fitzwarren and Dame Molde his wife, for whom he
erected a fair tomb in the church he before built, leaving also a
place for himself and Dame Alice his lady when it should
please God to call them. In which place they were afterwards
both of them according to their degree very honourably
interred, great mourning and much lamentation being made for
him by the Commons of the City in regard he was a man so
remarkable for his charity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>He builded another brave structure which he called after his
own name Whittington Colledge, with a perpetual allowance
for Divinity Lectures to be read there for ever, leaving good
land for the maintenance thereof.</p>

<p>And on the west side of the City he built that famous gate
and prison to this day called Newgate, and thereupon caused
the Merchants arms to be graven in stone. He added to St.
Bartholomew&#8217;s Hospital in Smithfield and was at the charge of
repairing thereof.</p>

<p>Further at the Grey-Fryars in London he erected a Library
as a testimony of the great love he had to Learning, which he
began in the year of our Lord 1421 and finished it in the year
following. Moreover that place which is called the Stocks to
this day, betwixt Cheapside and Cornhill, a good house of stone,
which for a flesh market and a fish market greatly beneficial to
the City.</p>

<p>Besides he enlarged Guild Hall and glazed most or all of the
windows at his own costs or charges, paving the Hall and contributing
largely to the Library, adding to those places a conduit
which yieldeth store of sweet and wholesome water to the
general good and benefit of the City.</p>

<p>In the year 1497, when Sir Richard Whittington was first
elected Lord Mayor, that rebel Sir John Oldcastle was taken
in the territories of the Lord Powess, not without danger and
hurt of some that took him, at which time all the States of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
realm were assembled at Parliament in London, therein to
provide the King of a subsidy and other aid of money and
ammunition, who took great pains beyond the seas in France.
These Lords and others when they heard that the publick
enemy was taken they agreed all not to dissolve the Parliament,
until he were examined, and heard to answer in the same.
Whereupon the Lord Powess was sent for to fetch him up
with power and great aid, who brought him to London in a
lyter wounded very much having received seventeen wounds
and also a clerk which he called his Secretary with him
that was of his counsel in all his secrecy. As soon as the
aforesaid Sir John Oldcastle was brought into the Parliament
before the Earl of Bedford who was then left Regent and
Governour of the Realm in the time of the King&#8217;s absence
being in France and other Lords and States, his indictment
being read before him of his forcible insurrection against the
King and State in St. Gyles&#8217;s Fields, and other treasons and
outrages by him committed, the question was asked how
he could excuse himself and show why he should not be
judged to dye according to the law. But he seeking other
talk and discourse of the mercies of God, and that all mortal
men that would be followers of God ought to prefer mercy
above judgment and that vengeance pertained only to the
Lord, and ought not to be practised by them that worship,
but to be left to God alone, with many other words to protract<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the time, until the Lord Chief Justice admonished the
Regent not to suffer him to spend the time so vainly, in
molesting the nobles of the Realm, whereupon the Duke of
Bedford, Regent, commanded him to answer formally and
punctually to the matter laid to his charge.</p>

<p>Then said Sir John, being thus urged at last after deliberation
taken, he said, It is the least thing that I account of to
be judged by you as of man&#8217;s judgment, and again he began
to talk, but nothing to the purpose until the Chief Justice
commanded him again to answer finally, and to answer them
if he could, why he should not suffer death according to his
desert. To which he stoutly answered that he had no judge
amongst them, so long as his liege Lord King Richard was
alive and in his realm of Scotland, which answer when he
had made, because there needed no further witness, he was
then presently censured to be drawn and hanged on a gallows
and then to be burnt hanging upon the same, which judgment
was executed upon him the thirtieth day of December in St.
Gyles&#8217;s Fields, where many honourable persons were present,
and the last words that he spake were to Sir Thomas Upingham,
adjuring him that if he saw him rise from death to life
again the third day he would procure that his sect which he
had raised might be in peace and quiet. He was hanged by
the neck in a chain of iron and after consumed by fire.</p>

<p>Moreover it is recorded that in the time of this worthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
pretor Sir Richard Whittington the glorious city of Constantinople
was taken by Mahomet the Second, Prince of the
Turks, whose souldiers sacked it with all extremity and
omitted no manners of cruelty by violence to either virgins,
aged women, or sucking babes. This Sir Richard Whittington
had traffick from thence by his factors which there abode,
and were then taken prisoners, so that he lost near upon
fifteen thousand pounds, which when he heard of never was
so much as cast down or dismayed, but said God will send
more; yea such was the incessant practice of the Turkish
tyranny upon this imperial city, as it exceeded the damage,
rapes and spoyls of other cities. They also beheaded at the
same time Constantine, sticking his head upon a launce, and
with derision caused it to be carried thorow the Turkish camp.</p>

<p>In the space of a week after, there hapned a horrible tempest
of thunder and lightning which burned almost eight hundred
houses and spoiled three thousand people at the sacking
of the aforesaid city by the said Mahomet. The Turks found
therein so much treasure that they wondred that the citizens
would not spend it in souldiers for their own defence, but so
dotingly to spare the true spending thereof to become an enticing
prey for their irreconcileable enemies, for indeed it was
thought that if the State would have hired souldiers, and given
them good pay they might have raised the siege of the Turks.
It is an old and true saying, Covetousness is the mother of
ruine and mischief.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>This strange thing hapned in the second time that he was
elected Lord Mayor and that was upon the twenty-seventh of
April, being Tuesday in Easter week: William Foxley, Pot
maker for the Mint in the Tower of London, fell asleep, and so
continued sleeping and snoring and could not be wakened with
pricking, cramping, or otherwise burning or whatsoever till the
first day of the term, which was full 14 days and 15 nights.
The cause of this his sleeping could not be known though the
same was diligently searched for by the King&#8217;s Command of
his Physicians and other learned men, yea the King himself
examined the said William Foxley, who was in all points sound
at his awaking to be as if he had slept but one night, and yet
lived 41 years after. But in length of time did call to mind
how he did wish to God that he might sleep a fortnight together
if it was not so and so concerning a bargain between a
neighbour of his and himself.</p>

<p>One Thursday in Whitson week following the Duke of
Somerset with Anthony Rivers and four others kept Justs and
Tournament before the King and Queen and others of the
nobility in the Tower of London, against three Esquires of the
Queen&#8217;s Bedchamber, which were performed before some of the
French nobility that then were Prisoners to the King, which
he took in France, to the great admiration of those strangers
who never saw the like action before, being so earnestly performed.
There was also Sir Richard Whittington and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Sheriffs, and that night the King and Queen did sup with the
Lord Mayor.</p>

<p>Those strangers which beheld those Justs were prisoners in
the Tower at that time, namely, the Duke of Orleance and
Burbon, brother to the Duke of Britain, the Earls of Vaudosine,
of Ewe and Richmond, and the High Marshal of
France, and many other Knights and Esquires to the number
of seven hundred, all which were at one time prisoners to the
King, but nobly used and attended every one according to their
rank and quality, who when they were ransomed made it
known to their King how honourably they were attended in
England, and what respect the King and our English nation
shewed them being prisoners who might have taken their lives
away as well as their persons prisoners.</p>

<p>The second thing that was remarkable in Sir Richard
Whittington&#8217;s year was that the King kept his Christmas at
Lambeth, and at the feast of Purification seven Dolphins of
the sea came up to the River of Thames and played there up
and down until four of them were kill&#8217;d.</p>

<p>On Saturday the eve of St. Michael the Archangel the year
following, in the morning before day, betwixt the hour of one
and two of the Clock, began a terrible earthquake with Lightning
and thunder which continued the space of six hours, and
that universally through the whole world, so that most men
thought the world as then would have ended. The unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
beasts roared and drew to the town with a hideous noise,
also the fowls of the ayr cryed out, such was the work of God
at that time to call his people to repentance.</p>

<p>The four and twentieth day of January following a battel or
combat was fought in Smithfield within the lists before the
King between the men of Feversham in Kent, John Upton
Notary Appelant and John Down Gentleman defendant. John
Upton accused John Down that he and his compiers should
design the King&#8217;s death on the day of his Coronation following.
When they had fought somewhat long and received each of
them some wounds, and still persisting in their violent action
and no hopes to find out the truth, the King took up the matter
and forgave both parties.</p>

<p>On Candlemas eve following in divers places of England was
great weathering of wind, hail, snow, rain with thunder and
lightning, whereby the church of Baldock in Hertfordshire and
the church and part of the town of Walden in Essex, with
other neighbouring villages, were sore shaken, and the steeple of
St. Pauls in London about two in the afternoon was set on fire
in the midst of the shaft first on the west side and then on the
south, and divers people espying the fire came to quench it in
the steeple, which they did with vinegar, so far as they could
find, so that when the Lord Mayor with much people came to
Pauls to have holpen if need had been they returned again
every man to his own home, trusting in God all had been well,
but anon after between eight and nine of the clock the fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
burst out again afresh out of the steeple, by reason of the wind
more hot and fervent then before, and did much hurt to the lead
and timber thereof. Then the Lord Mayor and many people
came thither again and with vinegar quenched the fire which
was so violent, but no man received any hurt.</p>

<p>Moreover in Sir Richard Whittington&#8217;s time lived one
Richard Fleming, Bishop of Lincoln, in the year 1430 who
founded Lincoln Colledge in Oxford, which was afterwards in
Richard the third&#8217;s time in the year of our Lord 1479 by
Thomas Rotherham Bishop of the same sea (<i>sic</i>) much augmented
and enlarged with great revenues. Likewise Magdalen
Colledge in Oxford was built by William Wainfleet Bishop of
Winchester, who was a loving and constant friend to Sir
Richard Whittington and did much good in many parts of this
kingdom, and the said Sir Richard did largely contribute to
these and the like pious uses by the intreaty of this Bishop.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord 1419, in which Sir Richard Whittington
was the third time inaugurated into the Mayoralty as
is before mentioned King Henry the fifth, who having conquered
the greatest part of France and espoused Katherine sole
daughter to the King and heir to the crown, taking leave of his
father-in-law, embarked with his Royal bride and landed at
Dover upon Candlemas Day, leaving in France for his deputy
his brother the Duke of Clarence, from thence arrived in
London the fourteenth day of February, and the Queen came
thither the one and twentieth day of the same month, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
met upon Black-Heath by the Lord Mayor and three hundred
aldermen and prime citizens in gold chains and rich costly
habits with other sumptuous and brave devices as pageants,
speeches and shows to the great delight and content of both
their Maiesties.</p>

<p>The four and twentieth day of February following being St.
Mathew&#8217;s Day her coronation was solemnized in St. Peter&#8217;s
Church in Westminster; which being ended, she was afterwards
royally conveyed into the great hall and there under a
rich canopy of State sat to dinner, upon whose right hand sate
at the end of the table the Lord Archbishop&#8217;s grace of Canterbury
and Henry called the rich Cardinal Bishop of Winchester,
upon the left hand of the Queen sat the King of Scots in a
chair of State, and was served with covered dishes, as the
Bishops were. But after them and upon the same side next
to the Boards end were seated the Dutchess of York and
Countess of Huntington, the Earl of March holding a scepter
in his hand, kneeling upon the right side, the Earl Marshal in
the like manner kneeled upon the left hand of the Queen: the
Countess of Kent sat under the table at the right foot, and the
Countess Marshal at the left foot of her Majesty.</p>

<p>Humphery Duke of Glocester was that day overseer and
stood before the Queen bareheaded, Sir Richard Newel was
carver and the Earl of Suffolk&#8217;s brother cup-bearer, Sir John
Stewart, Sewer, the Lord Clifford (instead of the Earl of Warwick)
Pantler, the Lord Willoby (instead of the Earl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Arundel) chief Butler, the Lord Gray Caterer, Naperer, the
Lord Audley (in the stead of the Earl of Cambridge) Almner,
the Earl of Worcester was Lord high Marshal, who rode about
the Hall on a great courser, with many tip-staves about him to
make room in the Hall. In the which Hall next after the
Queen, the Barons of the Cinque Ports began the table, upon
the right hand towards St. Steven&#8217;s Capel (<i>sic</i>), and beneath
them at the table sat the Vouchers of the Chancery, and upon
the left hand next to the cupboard sat Sir Richard Whittington
(now the third time Lord Mayor) and his brethren the
Aldermen of London. The rest of the Bishops began the
table over against the Baron of the Cinque Ports, and the
ladies and chief noble-women the table against the Lord Mayor
and the Aldermen, at which two tables of the Bishops the
Bishop of London and the Bishop of Durham sat highest at
the one and the Countess of Stafford and the Countess of
March on the other. And for ordering of the service divers
chief lords were appointed officers as Steward, Controuler,
Surveyor, and the like, which places were supplyed by the Earls
of Northumberland and Westmorland, the Lord Fizmur, the
Lord Farneval, the Lord Gray of Wilton, the Lord Feres of
Groby, the Lord Poynings, the Lord Harrington, the Lord
Ducy, the Lord Daker, the Lord Delaware, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have shewed you onely the ordering of this rich feast, but
the cost and sumptuousness of the fare would ask too long and
large a circumstance to discourse; what I have hitherto done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
was onely to show to the world that at those high solemnities
inaugurations and coronations the Lord Mayor of the City of
London and the Aldermen have place, and their presence is still
required; the City being the King&#8217;s Chamber and in an interregnum
he the first and prime officer in the kingdom. But I
fear I have dwelt too long on the premises which I hope none
will hold for an unnecessary deviation. I come now to discourse
unto you of Sir Richard Whittington&#8217;s invitation of the King
and Queen into the City when he bountifully feasted them in
his own house at his own proper charge.</p>

<p>How great and magnificent the Londoners feasts be even
amongst themselves especially at that high and pompous festival
at Guild-Hall the day after Simon and Jude, at the solemn
inauguration of his Lordship who but knows, as also the ordinary
Tables of the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs where there is free
and generous entertainment for all men of fashion and quality,
the like both for plenty of dishes and order of service is not
elsewhere to be or found through Europe. If then their daily
provision be so curious and costly, what may we think their
variety and rarity was at the invitation and entertainment of
two such great majesties? I must therefore leave it to the
Readers imagination being so far transcending my expression.
Let it therefore give satisfaction to any one that shall doubt
thereof, that it was performed to the everlasting reputation of
the honour of the city and great content of these royal personages
invited. The bounty of the table not to be question&#8217;d.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
I come now to the fire that he made in the Presence chamber
where the King and Queen then dined, which was only of
sweet and odoriferious (<i>sic</i>) wood, far exceeding the smell of
juniper, for it was mixed with mace, cinnamon, and other rare
and costly spices, which did cast such a pleasant and delightful
savor through the room that it pleased his majesty to call him
unto him and say, my good Lord Mayor, though your fare be
choice, costly and abundant, yet above all things I have observed
in your noble entertainment this fire which you have provided
for me gives me more content. To whom Sir Richard
Whittington making a low obeysance made answer, It much
rejoyceth me dread Soveraign that any that remaineth in my
power can give your highness the least cause to be pleased,
but since you praise this fire already made I purpose ere your
sacred majesty depart the house to entertain you with one (I
hope) that shall content you much better. The King not
thinking it could be possible desired him to make a proof thereof,
when he (having before provided himself for that purpose)
brought a great bundle of Bonds, Indentures and Covenants
under his arm, said thus to the King, Royal Soveraign to
whom I owe both my fortunes and my life, I have here a faggot
of purpose left for this fire, which I hope will smell much more
sweetly than the first in your nostrils, for saith he, here is
first your Highness security for ten thousand marks, lent you
for the maintainance of your royal wars in France, by the
Right Worshipful Company of the Mercers, which I here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
cancel and cast into the fire, fifteen hundred lent by the City to
your Majesty I send after the former, two thousand marks
borrowed of the Grocers Company, three thousand of the Merchant
Taylors, one thousand of the Drapers, one thousand of
the Skinners, one thousand of the Ironmongers, one thousand
of the Merchant Staplers, of the Goldsmiths three thousand, of
the Haberdashers as much, of the Vintners, Brewers and Brown
Bakers three thousand marks. All these you see are cancel&#8217;d
and burnt, saith he, with divers other bonds for money lent by
my father in law Aldermen Fitzwarren for the payment of your
souldiers in France, which coming unto me by executorship I
have taken in and discharged.</p>

<p>Others there likewise due to me of no small sums by divers
of your nobility here present, all which with the former I have
sacrificed to the love and honour of my dread sovereign, amounting
to the sum of three score thousand pounds sterling, and can
your Majesty (saith he) desire to sit by a fire of more sweet scent
and savour? At this the King was much extasi&#8217;d and the rather
because it came unexpectedly and from so free a spirit, and
embracing him in his arms said unto him that he thought never
King had such a subject, and at his departure did him all the
grace and honour that could descend from a King to a subject,
promising him moreover that he should ever stand in the first
rank of those whom he favoured. And so the Lord Mayor
bearing the sword before their two most sacred Majesties as far
as Temple Bar the King for his former service and his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
kind and loving entertainment at that time, and the noble men
for that extraordinary courtesie offered them all unitely (<i>sic</i>) and
unanimously commended his goodness, applauded his bounty and
wished that he might live to perpetual memory and so bid both
him and the City for that time adieu.</p>

<p>To omit all other circumstances having acquainted you
with the poor and mean estate of this Sir Richard Whittington
when he came first into the City of London, and by what
means he was relieved in his miserable poverty, as also the
fortunate success of his small adventure whereby he was raised
unto so great honour, that he became the Cities Governour, and
how discreetly and wisely he behaved in his authority and office,
gaining thereby the love and probation (<i>sic</i>) of all men. And
further having shewed you what goodly buildings have been
raised by his great cost and charge, as one church, two colledges,
and certain almshouses, with yearly means left for the maintenance
of all such as shall be admitted into them, and many other
charitable acts performed by him which are before related, to the
great good and benefit of the City, and what things of note
happened in his time, I will now conclude with Master Stow,
O that London had a Park near adjoining to it, stored with
such Deer (as doubtless it hath, though not easily known) for
some build Alms houses, free schools, causies and Bridges in
needful and necessary places, others repair ruinated and decayed
churches, relieving Hospitals in a bountiful manner, and are
weekly benefactors to Prisons and those performed by such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
agents faithfully, that the true bestowers are not publicly noted,
howsoever they may be easily supposed. But the glory they
seek to invade here will (no doubt) for ever shine on them elsewhere.
And that great God who hath created us, and plentifully
distributed in his great bounty all things to men, and yet
not given all things to any one man, lest it might take away
that necessary commerce and mutual society which ought to be
amongst us, stir up the minds of more of them to imitate at
least, though not to exceed them in their bounty and liberality.</p>
